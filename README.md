# GetEnv

Trivial gem which handles reading from environment variables and coerces the values into integers, floats or True or False. `GetEnv` implements `#[]` and `#fetch` mimicking `Hash`'s behaviour.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'get_env'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install get_env

## Usage

```ruby
GetEnv['YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE']
GetEnv.fetch('YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE') # Will raise a KeyError
```

## Development

After checking out the repo run `rake spec` to run the tests.

Releasing is handled by the CI based on git tags. Once your changes are merged into `master` branch (make sure you've bumped the `VERSION` in `version.rb` file) run `rake release:source_control_push` to release.
